# This file makes Python treat the 'services' directory as a package.

# Optionally, you can make service functions directly available for import from the package, e.g.:
# from .prediction_service import predict_fill_levels, train_waste_prediction_model
# from .data_service import get_active_fleet_vehicles, get_latest_waste_readings_for_bins
# For now, keeping it simple and requiring explicit imports from the modules.
